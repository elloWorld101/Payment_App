## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.js, it handles the API routes and database operations.
2. **Frontend**: Built with React and Vite, it provides the user interface for interacting with the application.

### Backend

The backend provides several API routes for managing accounts, authentication, and user details. You can find detailed information about these routes in the backend's [README file](./backend/README.md).

### Frontend

The frontend includes several pages like Landing, Signup, Signin, Dashboard, Update and Send Money. Each page provides specific functionalities to the user. Detailed descriptions of these pages can be found in the frontend's [README file](./frontend/README.md).
